An obsolete reference is simply a reference that will never be dereferenced again.
In this case, any references outside of the “active portion” of the element array are obsolete.

Memory leaks in garbage-collected languages (more properly known as unintentional object retentions) are
insidious. If an object reference is unintentionally retained, not only is that object excluded from garbage
collection, but so too are any objects referenced by that object, and so on. Even if only a few object
references are unintentionally retained, many, many objects may be prevented from being garbage collected,
with potentially large effects on performance.
